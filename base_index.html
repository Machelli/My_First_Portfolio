    <h1>My Favorite Game: [The last of us]</h1>
    <p>Masterclass in Narrative: The game's story is its strongest element. The relationship between Joel and Ellie is one of the most well-written and emotionally resonant character arcs in any medium, not just gaming. It explores complex themes of love, loss, sacrifice, and the dark side of human nature with incredible maturity.Narrative and Gameplay Integration: The gameplay isn't just a separate activity; it reinforces the story's themes. The desperate scarcity of resources, the brutal and clumsy combat, and the constant tension all make the player feel the desperation of the world, directly connecting them to the characters' struggles.</p>
